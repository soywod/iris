## Motivation

(Neo)Mutt and Alpine are very good terminal mail clients, but they lack of Vim
mappings. You can emulate, but it requires a lot of time, patience and
configuration. Why trying to emulate, when you can have it in Vim? VimL and
Python are strong enough to do so. The aim of Iris is to provide a simple mail
client that:

  - Allows you to manage your mails inside Vim
  - Does not slow down neither Vim nor your workflow (async+lazy)
  - Is built on the top of a robust [Python IMAP client](https://github.com/mjs/imapclient) to avoid implementing IMAP protocol logic

## Requirements

You need either Neovim or Vim8+ with:

  - Python3 support enabled `:echo has("python3")`
  - Job enabled `:echo has("job")`
  - Channel enabled `:echo has("channel")`

## Installation

For eg. with [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug "soywod/iris.vim"
```

## Configuration

Before using Iris, you need to configure it:

### Identity (required)

```vim
let g:iris_name  = "My name"
let g:iris_mail = "your@mail.com"
```

### IMAP (required)

```vim
let g:iris_imap_host  = "your.imap.host"
let g:iris_imap_port  = 993
let g:iris_imap_login = "Your IMAP login" "Default to g:iris_mail
```

### SMTP (required)

```vim
let g:iris_smtp_host  = "your.smtp.host" "Default to g:iris_imap_host
let g:iris_smtp_port  = 587
let g:iris_smtp_login = "Your IMAP login" "Default to g:iris_mail
```

### Passwords

On startup, Iris always asks for your IMAP and SMTP passwords. To avoid this,
you can save your password in a file and encrypt it via
[GPG](https://gnupg.org/):

```bash
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor --output myfile.gpg myfile
```

```vim
let g:iris_imap_passwd_filepath = "/path/to/imap.gpg"
let g:iris_smtp_passwd_filepath = "/path/to/smtp.gpg"
```

Note: `iris_imap_passwd_filepath` & `iris_smtp_password_filepath` must be absolute paths.  For example the path `~/passwords/imap.gpg` would not work because of the `~`.

If you want to use something else than GPG, you can set up your custom command.
For eg., with the MacOSX `security` tool:

```vim
let g:iris_imap_passwd_show_cmd = "security find-internet-password -gs IMAP_KEY -w"
let g:iris_smtp_passwd_show_cmd = "security find-internet-password -gs SMTP_KEY -w"
```

### Idle mode

On startup, Iris spawns two Python jobs: one for the API, one for the [idle
mode](https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/advanced.html#watching-a-mailbox-using-idle).
The last one allows you to receive notifications on new mails. You can disable
this option or change the default timeout (every 15s):

```vim
let g:iris_idle_enabled = 1
let g:iris_idle_timeout = 15
```

### Pagination

By default, Iris fetches your last 50 mails:

```vim
let g:iris_emails_chunk_size = 50
```

*Note: the pagination is based on message sequences which is not necessary
consecutive. It makes the pagination less accurate (doesn't fetch always the
same amount of mails) but more performant.*

### Attachments

```vim
let g:iris_download_dir = "~/Downloads"
```

## Usage

### Email list

```vim
:Iris
```

Function | Default keybind | Override
--- | --- | ---
Preview (text) | `<Enter>` | `nmap <cr> <plug>(iris-preview-text-email)`
Preview (html) | `gp` (for `go preview`) | `nmap gp <plug>(iris-preview-html-email)`
Download attachments | `ga` (for `go attachments`) | `nmap ga <plug>(iris-download-attachments)`
New mail | `gn` (for `go new`) | `nmap gn <plug>(iris-new-email)`
Previous page | `<Ctrl+b>` (for `page backward`) | `nmap <c-b> <plug>(iris-prev-page-emails)`
Next page | `<Ctrl+f>` (for `page forward`) | `nmap <c-f> <plug>(iris-next-page-emails)`
Change folder | `gf` (for `go folder`) | `nmap gf <plug>(iris-change-folder)`

### Email text preview

Function | Default keybind | Override
--- | --- | ---
Reply | `gr` (for `go reply`) | `nmap gr <plug>(iris-reply-email)`
Reply all | `gR` (for `go reply all`) | `nmap gR <plug>(iris-reply-all-email)`
Forward | `gf` (for `go forward`) | `nmap gf <plug>(iris-forward-email)`

### Email composition

Iris is based on the builtin `mail.vim` filetype and syntax. An email should
contains a list of headers followed by the message:

```vim
To: mail@test.com
Subject: Welcome

Hello world!
```

Function | Default keybind | Override
--- | --- | ---
Save draft | `:w` |
Send | `gs` (for `go send`) | `nmap gs <plug>(iris-send-email)`

### Folders

By default, Iris will display a basic prompt to select your folders:

```vim
:IrisFolder
```

Iris supports those fuzzy finders:

  - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) ([fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) need to be installed as well)

*Note: Iris will use the first fuzzy finder available automatically.*

### Flags

Flags appears in the first column of the [email list](#email-list) view. There
is 5 different flags:

  - `N` if it's a new email
  - `R` if it has been replied
  - `F` if it has been flagged
  - `D` if it's a draft
  - `@` if it contains an attachment

### Contacts

In order to autocomplete addresses, Iris keeps a `.contacts` file that contains
emails of your contacts. It's updated each time you send a new email (only the
`To` header is used). You can extract existing addresses from all your emails:

```vim
:IrisExtractContacts
```

*Note: the completion may need to be triggered manually via `<C-x><C-u>`, see
`:h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U`.*

## Contributing

Git commit messages follow the [Angular
Convention](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153), but
contain only a subject.

  > Use imperative, present tense: ‚Äúchange‚Äù not ‚Äúchanged‚Äù nor
  > ‚Äúchanges‚Äù<br>Don't capitalize first letter<br>No dot (.) at the end

Code should be as clean as possible, variables and functions use the snake case
convention. A line should never contain more than `80` characters.

Tests should be added for each new functionality. Be sure to run tests before
proposing a pull request.
